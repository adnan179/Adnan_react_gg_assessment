## Question:

### Tasks:
-Create a simple Task Manager in React where users can:
-Add new tasks
-Mark tasks as completed or pending
-Delete tasks

**Initially, use the useState hook to manage the list of tasks.**

Once itâ€™s working, refactor your code to use the **useReducer hook** to handle the task state more efficiently, especially as the number of possible actions (add, update, delete) grows. Structure your reducer with proper action types and make sure each part of your logic is clean and maintainable.

Bonus: Style the component using Tailwind CSS to match a minimal dark theme with a yellow highlight for the action button.
